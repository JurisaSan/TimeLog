## Features

This application is designed to work seamlessly with Microsoft CRM, 
offering a more flexible approach to time logging. 
The optimal way to utilize this application involves recording the time spent on each task, 
followed by manual entry of this data into the CRM system. 
The applicationâ€™s most significant advantage becomes apparent when managing four or more tasks. 
It allows for swift switching between task timers, eliminating the need to open the CRM system repeatedly, 
thus saving valuable time.

## Installation
